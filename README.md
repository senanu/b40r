# R Markdown files for Bio40

This repository contains files needed to complete lab assignments by students in Bio 40.

The Rmd files are within the "R" directory. Knitted html files are provided in the "sample_html" directory. These files have been knitted from their native state and should be used as reference only in the case in which students struggle to read and/or knit their Rmd documents to html. The files are linked below:
